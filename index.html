          Hi and welcome to my page. My name is Fernando Gaol and I am based in
          Provo, UT. My story as a developer started when I was 13 and I decided
          to build a game. I was able to pull it off by watching tutorials, but
          I had no idea how that code worked. From there on, I tried building
          more complex games, but my abilities were limited. I failed multiple
          times so I decided to learn more in depth how to code. However, when I
          was searching for game development on the web, I also found web
          development. For some reason, web development caught my attention the
          most so I started taking some courses on Code Academy such as HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript. I started coding for hours every day so that I
          could get better at what I like to do the most. Over time, I improved
          a lot and gained more skills, but I got to a point where the courses
          were no longer helping me learn and I hit a plato. That is why I am
          currently taking a Full Stack Bootcamp at Thinkful. My goal is make to
          the best out of it and utilize all the resources that I now have
          available such as mentors, instructors and technical support. I
          strongly believe that with this cohort, I will be able to fill in the
          gap and gain the skills I have not yet been able to acquire. Apart
          from coding, I like to play soccer, volleyball, and play games on the
          computer such as League of Legends, Call of Duty, and more. I also
          like learning new languages and spending time with friends and family,
          even though I spend most of my days on the computer. Other than that,
          I am married and I don't have any kids yet, but I do plan to have a
          couple of them after I develop my skills as a web developer.
